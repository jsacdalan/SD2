The Source ("src") directory contains the actual program source code, partitioned into various levels of functionality.  

The architecture and partitioning of embedded software can minimize adverse interactions between the hardware implementation and the desired observable functionality.  "Layered" software architectures with "abstraction" layers between the layers of code is one such organization. Here are a few related links for reference:

Organization of the project's directory structure can facilitate maintenance of the layered software architecture. Please feel free to adopt and adapt this proposed folder structure in your projects.

Proposal:
The root of the source directory contains the architectural partitioning of the overall program.  The deeper levels of subdirectories contain "packages" of source code to fulfill a specific function in the overall program.

Each "package" of source code (self contained in a subdirectory) should contain a standard set of files along with any additional files necessary.  Some representative files for an example package "ABC" might be:

Directory: abc.dir
* abc.c - definitions of functions, static variables, etc., related to the "ABC" package.
* abc.h - declares any functions and variables, macro definitions, etc. that will be used by external functions.
* abc_api.h - This file is #included by any external file that will use the resources of the "ABC" package.  Any necessary resource files for "ABC" should be #included in this file.
* abc_cfg.h - symbol definitions (#defines) for modifying the behavior of the ABC functions should be defined in this file.  This allows reconfiguring of the function behavior without modifying the actual function source code.
* abc_make.mak - or something like that, if the project uses "make-files" or "build scripts" to compile the program.
