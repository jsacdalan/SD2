The "Service" level is an interface level between the target independent Applicaiton layer (App) and the target specific Driver (Drv) layer.

Service layer components may perform interface functions such as filtering analog inputs, "debouncing" digital inputs, decoding network messages into signals, conversion of binary data into "engineering" units (ex: Analog-to-Digital "counts" into volts, timer "ticks" into milliseconds), etc.

In this subdirectory, create a folder for each Service "component".
