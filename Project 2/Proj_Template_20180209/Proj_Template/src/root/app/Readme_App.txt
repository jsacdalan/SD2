The "Application" level functions are the portions of the program that perform the "observable" work that is specified in the functional requirements.  Well architected software isolates the Application functionality (independent of the target environment) from any hardware specific implementation.

In this subdirectory, create a subdirectory for each Application.  In Requirements and High-Level ("Architectural") design, the overall system should be partitioned into major "chunks"; these "chunks" (and further sub-divisions of them) are good candidates for partitioning into an Application.
